# To Do List:
+ Implement Steam search mode into commands

+ Integrate Reddit component
  + **Make the output prettier**
+ Possible command ideas:
  + `children <xpath>`: Return the children for selected nodes
  + `assemblysearch <name>`: Searches `Assembly-CSharp` for the specified type/member
+ Misc bugs:
+ Away with the fairies:
  + ThingDef-style command loading (maybe with JSON? Started on ExposableCommand)

# To Do List:
+ Implement Steam search mode into commands
+ A !version command for Discord component
+ ~~A `{{MuffaloBotIgnore}}` option for Reddit~~
+ Make xpath command look prettier with Reddit code formatting
+ Integrate CommandsNext component
+ Possible command ideas:
  + ~~`children <xpath>`: Return the children for selected nodes~~ (Can simply be replaced with /* in XPath syntax)
  + `assemblysearch <name>`: Searches `Assembly-CSharp` for the specified type/member
+ Misc bugs:
+ Away with the fairies:
  + ThingDef-style command loading (maybe with JSON? Started on ExposableCommand)

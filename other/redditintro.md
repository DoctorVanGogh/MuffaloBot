(Begin poorly written backstory)

> Once upon a time on August 21 2017, a muffalo was born. He was adopted by a passing caravan traveller, who nicknamed him Muffy. He brought Muffy back to his home colony.  

The animal trainer of the colony, spdskatr, loved Muffy and taught him tricks, like searching the wiki, and bringing up stats for items. Muffy soon became the information powerhouse for RimWorld.

At the faction's annual muffalo fair, spdskatr spotted the great admins of the Discord strolling in the distance. He quickly brought Muffy over and showed off Muffy's tricks. The admins were impressed, and added Muffy to the Discord under a different name.

MuffaloBot loved the attention of the Discord users. Spdskatr continued to train him over the coming months, and care for his wool (superior). A month later, one of the subreddit moderators noticed Muffy and went over to spdskatr. They said:

> I really like MuffaloBot, particularly the workshopsearch function. Would you consider expanding its functionality to include the /r/RimWorld subreddit?

Spdskatr's eyes lit up. The *subreddit*!??!? It was one of his biggest dreams to put Muffy on the subreddit. He quickly brought Muffy and groomed his wool (excellent). He dressed Muffy up and prepared for the grand release on the RimWorld subreddit.

After 9 more days, spdskatr was finally ready to make his grand appearance. Making a brand new reddit account (why the squirrel didn't he make a reddit account before, he's literally missing out on half the community), he excitedly typed into the text box:

Ok enough of the backstory. If you're a discord user you're probably very fond of Muffy. Well, Muffy's arrived on the subreddit! \o/ Hooray!

What else do I write... Oh yeah. The commands reference is [here](https://github.com/spdskatr/MuffaloBot/blob/master/CommandsReference.md), the source code can be found on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/spdskatr/MuffaloBot), and yes, I literally realised that I didn't have a reddit account last week.
